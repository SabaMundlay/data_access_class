#DataAccess
This repo is part of a larger collection of code documenting the work that 23 Wheaton College, MA Students have done over the course of 14-weeks to develop products designed to better help patients manage Type 1 Diabetes. This specific read me is documenting the work that a few students did to set up the database for the entire class.

##Our Goals
1. To make available what we have done 
2. To effectively collaborate with each other

##Workflow of steps
We present a workflow of steps that were taken to set up the database, using sqlite3 (in python), and a flask server (in python). The database is accessible through a website, programmed using JQuery in javascript. We have the following functionaity

###step_0_updateDB:
###step_1_updateRow:
###step_2_getData:
###step_3_getColumnNames:
###step_4_addColumn:
