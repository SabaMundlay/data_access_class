#This is the actual read me for our database. 


Function: addColumn(self,colName, vals)
To add a new column to the existing database, simply call this 
function where colName is a string representing the name of the 
column you want to add. vals is a dictionary containing values
that you want this new column populated with. The dictionary must
contain datetime objects paired with the value to be put into the 
column. This is so the function knows where to insert each value 
based on the date that it is paired with. If you do not want to 
add any values to the new column, simply send an empty dictionary.

Function: getColumnNames(self)
To get all of the column names that are in the existing 
database, simply call this function. The function takes in no 
arguments and returns a list of the column names in the database.

Function: getNextID(self,conn)
Call this function to get the highest ID currently in the 
database. This functon only takes in the connection path
as an argument and does not return anything; it just changes
the value of 'self.__nextID'.
